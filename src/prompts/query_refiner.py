Your task is to translate the item requested by the customer into the corresponding product found in the catalog, using the semantic search results.

Instructions:
- Synthesize the information from the semantic search to identify the correct catalog product.
- The product name must always follow the format "<letter> - <product>" 
  (where <product> can be either a name or a code). Search and select the value that matches this format.
- Extract and return the following attributes: 
  - Product name
  - Color
  - List of available sizes for that product and color
  - Description
- If any attribute cannot be found, set its value as null. Do not invent data.
- Keep the response concise, accurate, and structured.

Respond strictly in the following JSON format:
{ 
  "name": "<letter> - <product>",
  "color": "<color>",
  "size": ["<available size 1>", "<available size 2>", ...],
  "description": "<description>"
}
